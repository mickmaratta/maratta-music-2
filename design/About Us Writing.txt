About
Whether we're driving, watching TV, or putting on a old vinyl record, music impacts our life everyday .  Although music surrounds us all the time, many of us spend very little time getting to understand and appreciate the art. I have been teaching music for the last 10+ years and I strongly believe ANYONE CAN LEARN HOW TO PLAY AND ENJOY MUSIC! Learning an instrument can be one of the most rewarding experiences. It is not only FUN but very challenging and teaches valuable life skills such as work ethic, time management, creative thinking and much more. I have had the benefit of learning from a variety of teachers while studying at York University including Artie Roth, Mike Cado and Kelly Jefferson.  I have also had the privilege of being mentored and coached by the legendary bass guitarist Prakash John (Lou Reed, Alice Cooper, The Lincolns). After realizing the demand for in-home lessons I decided to find some of the best teachers in the city to help share the gift of music.
